## How to use

This project depends on Clippi to know when matches are finished. To achieve this, setup a Clippi Automator that writes any amount of text to `C:\Users\[user]\Documents\clippifile.txt`, every time a match ends. Make sure Clippi says "Connected" in the corner of the window.

Clone the repository run the batch file by double clicking `start.bat`.
